# Birkhoff's algorithm for doubly stochastic matrices #

This package contains a Python 3 implementation of Birkhoff's algorithm for
decomposing a doubly stochastic matrix into a convex combination of permutation
matrices.

## Basic usage ##

    import numpy
    from birkhoff import birkhoff_von_neumann_decomposition

    # Create a doubly stochastic matrix.
    #
    # D = numpy.array(...)

    # The decomposition is given as a list of pairs in which the right element
    # is a permutation matrix and the left element is the scalar coefficient
    # applied to that permutation matrix in the convex combination
    # representation of the doubly stochastic matrix.
    result = birkhoff_von_neumann_decomposition(D)
    for coefficient, permutation_matrix in result:
        print('coefficient:', coefficient)
        print('permutation matrix:', permutation_matrix)
